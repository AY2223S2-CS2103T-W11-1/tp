### Project: Wingman

Wingman is an application designed to help airline managers efficiently manage the allocation of their resources.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Features Worked On**
* **New Feature**: Handled implementation for the resource, Plane
    * Responsible for implementing all the basic functions for the resource, Plane. Such functions include adding and 
    deleting a Plane from Wingman.

    * **What it does:** 
    * **Justification:** 
    * **Highlights:** 
    * **Credits:** *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*


* **New Feature**: Added an availability feature for Crew, Pilot, and Plane
    * **What it does:** Allows for Crew, Pilot, and Plane to be marked as available or unavailble, depending on whether 
  they are linked to a Flight. This feature works with the `linkflight` command ie. when any of the resources are linked
  to a flight, they automatically become unavailable. Additionally, a `check` command was added which allows users to
  check the availability of a Crew, Pilot, or Plane.

    * **Justification:** This feature is essential for airline managers as their scheduling depends on the
  availability of their resources. With the`check` command, airline manager's no longer have to look through the list of
  resources - thereby, making it easier for them to check a resource's availability.
  
    * **Highlights**: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())
    * Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests [\#36](), [\#38]())

[//]: # (TO EDIT)
* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `delete` and `find` [\#72]()
        * Did cosmetic tweaks to existing documentation of features `clear`, `exit`: [\#74]()
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

[//]: # (TO EDIT)
* **Community**:
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
    * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())

[//]: # (TO EDIT)
* **Tools**:
    * Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project ([\#42]())
    * Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
