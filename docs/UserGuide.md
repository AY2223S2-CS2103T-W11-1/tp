Wingman is a resource management tool designed for airline managers that allows for efficient management of crew,
flights, locations, pilots, and planes via command lines. The functionalities include adding, deleting, checking, or associating these
airline-related resources. The program is highly optimized for fast typers, while having an intuitive graphical interface
for managers to monitor the status of airline-related resources. 

In this flight, we will guide you on how to use Wingman to efficiently manage the various aspects of airline operations,
such as flight scheduling and management of crew, pilot, plane and location.

## How to use this guide?

This user guide provides an in-depth documentation on the multiple features that enable Wingman
to assist you in managing your resources.

If you are an experienced user trying to find a specific command, you can head over to
the [command summary](#command-summary) section where you can view all the commands at a glance.

If you are a first-time user, you can begin by reading the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to learn how to
get started with Wingman in just a few simple steps!

To find an in depth description of Wingman's features, simply search for the feature in the
[table of contents](#table-of-contents) and head over to the relevant section.
Each section contains a detailed description of the feature, and it's command format 
along with some examples of possible uses and expected outputs.

For the description of commands, `{resource}_index` (e.g. `plane_index`) acts a placeholder in the command format where
a
plane's index would be inputted. The index of any resource can be found as the number next to it in the list. Please
refer to the image below for clarity.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Getting Started

You can get started with Wingman in just 3 simple steps:

1. Ensure you have `JAVA 11` installed on your computer. If you are unsure how to check JAVA version on your computer,
please check out [FAQ](#faq). 
2. Click [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3) to download the Wingman.jar file
3. Open a command terminal on your computer, and run the command to start the application:  `java -jar Wingman.jar`

A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

<div style="border: 0px solid #ccc; background-color: #d9edff; color: darkblue; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
Note how the app below contains some sample data. This may not be the case if it's your first time using Wingman.
</div>

(If you encounter any issues during installation, please head over to our [FAQ](#faq) section to troubleshoot.)

Congratulations on successfully setting up Wingman!
Before you start using Wingman to manage your resources, do take a moment to read
the following section on [Modal Editing](#modal-editing) to understand how Wingman's commands are structured.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Modal Editing

Wingman offers 5 different modes through which you can manage your resources, with each mode
corresponding to one [resource](#glossary) that the app can manage:

- `crew` mode: to manage the crews that form your airline workforce
- `flight` mode: to manage the flights that your airline operates
- `location` mode: to manage the locations in which your airline operates
- `pilot` mode: to manage the pilots that form your airline workforce
- `plane` mode: to manage the planes that your airline operates

The different modes offer similar and intuitive commands, with optimisations to cater to the resource
that the mode is managing. This means you do not have to worry about memorising complex commands and instead
can dive right into the management of your airline.

To switch between different modes simply enter the following command:

```
mode XYZ
```

where XYZ can be any of the modes described above (i.e. `crew`, `flight`, `location`, `pilot`, `plane`).

<img src="images/ModeCrewLanding.jpg" width="2032" alt="Switching to mode crew">

As shown in the image above, upon successfully switching to a mode, Wingman will
display the current mode's name in the status bar in the bottom left corner of the window.
The window also displays a list for each resource, to aid you in keeping track of links between resources.

## Features

### Shared Commands

The commands in this section are available across ALL 5 modes.

#### 1. Adding a resource

Use this command when you wish to add a new resource entity (e.g. a new plane that has been added to your fleet)
to Wingman, for you to manage the resource.

```
add /prefix_A value_A /prefix_B value_B
```

This commands adds an entity of the current resource mode to Wingman's database. For example,
if you are currently in the `plane` mode, then this command will add a new `plane` to the database.
Each `/prefix` is an attribute of the resource entity, and you can specify the values
for each attribute as shown in the following examples.

<div style="border: 0px solid #ccc; background-color: #d9edff; color: darkblue; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 2. Deleting a resource

Use this command when you wish to remove a resource entity (e.g. a pilot that has retired)
from Wingman, to keep your database of resources up to date.

```

```

This commands deletes an entity of the current resource mode from Wingman's database. For example,
if you are currently in the `plane` mode, then this command will delete the specified `plane` from the database.

This command has no variations across modes:

##### All modes: `delete 3`

Prefix:

- `index_number`: the index number of the resource entity you wish to delete. Note that the indexing starts from 1.

The index number of an entity can be obtained from its position in the displayed list.

Example (in `plane` mode):

```
Input:
delete 1

Output: 
Deleted A380.
```

For instance, Flight Attendant Mary will have an index number of 1 in the image below.
(The index number will be displayed in future updates)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mode-specific Commands

The commands in this section are only available in some modes.

#### 1. Linking a resource to a location

Use this command when you wish to link a resource entity to a location
(e.g. a pilot that has just landed in Dubai can have his location set as Dubai, so you are able to identify
the correct pilots when filtering the pilots by location).

```
linklocation /lo location_index /resource_prefix resource_index
```

This command is ONLY available in the following modes: `crew`, `flight`, `pilot` and `plane`.

This commands links an entity of the current resource mode to a specified location entity in Wingman's database.

For example, if you are currently in the `plane` mode, then this command will link a `plane` to a specified location 
entity in the database.

<div style="border: 0px solid #ccc; background-color: #d9edff; color: darkblue; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

#### 2. Unlinking a resource from a location

Use this command when you wish to unlink a resource entity from a location
(e.g. when a plane has departed from Milan, you can unlink it from Milan,
so you get the correct information when filtering planes by location).

```
unlinklocation /lo location_index /resource_prefix resource_index
```

Same as `linklocation` command, this command is ONLY available in the following modes: `crew`, `flight`, `pilot`
and `plane`.

This commands unlinks an entity of the current resource mode to a specified location entity in Wingman's database.
For example, if you are currently in the `plane` mode, then this command will unlink a `plane`
from the specified location entity in the database.

#### 5. Checking a resource's availability

Use this command when you wish to check a resource's availability (i.e. when deciding to use a resource for flight, you
can use this command to check whether the resource is already currently linked to another flight).

```
check /id resource_index
```

This command is ONLY available in the following modes: `crew`, `pilot` and `plane`.

This command checks whether an entity of the current resource is currently linked to a flight in Wingman's database.
For example, if you are currently in `plane` mode, then this command will check whether the specified `plane` is linked
to any flights or not and indicate its availability.

This command is the same across `crew`, `pilot`, and `plane`.

Example (in `plane` mode):

```
Input:
check /id 1

Output: 
A380 is available.
```
