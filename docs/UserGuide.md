Wingman is a resource management tool designed for airline managers that allows for efficient management of crew,
flights, locations, pilots, and planes via command lines. The functionalities include adding, deleting, checking, or
associating these
airline-related resources. The program is highly optimized for fast typers, while having an intuitive graphical
interface
for managers to monitor the status of airline-related resources.

In this flight, we will guide you on how to use Wingman to efficiently manage the various aspects of airline operations,
such as flight scheduling and management of crew, pilot, plane and location.

## How to use this guide?

This user guide provides an in-depth documentation on the multiple features that enable Wingman
to assist you in managing your resources.

If you are an experienced user trying to find a specific command, you can head over to
the [command summary](#command-summary) section where you can view all the commands at a glance.

If you are a first-time user, you can begin by reading the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section to learn how to
get started with Wingman in just a few simple steps!

To find an in depth description of Wingman's features, simply search for the feature in the
[table of contents](#table-of-contents) and head over to the relevant section.
Each section contains a detailed description of the feature, and it's command format
along with some examples of possible uses and expected outputs.

For the description of commands, `{resource}-index` (e.g. `plane-index`) acts a placeholder in the command format where
a plane's index would be inputted. The index of any resource can be found as the number next to it in the list. Please
refer to the image below for clarity.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Getting Started

You can get started with Wingman in just 3 simple steps:

1. Ensure you have `JAVA 11` installed on your computer. If you are unsure how to check JAVA version on your computer,
   please check out [FAQ](#faq).
2. Click [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.3) to download the Wingman.jar file
3. Open a command terminal on your computer, and run the command to start the application:  `java -jar Wingman.jar`

A GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds.

<div style="border: 0px solid #ccc; background-color: #d9edff; color: darkblue; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
Take note how the app below contains some sample data. This may not be the case if it's your first time using Wingman.
</div>

<img src = "images/UG-start.png" width="2032">

(If you encounter any issues during installation, please head over to our [FAQ](#faq) section to troubleshoot.)

Congratulations on successfully setting up Wingman! Before you start using Wingman, do take a moment to read the
following sections:

1. [Modal Editing](#modal-editing) to understand how Wingman's commands are operated.
2. [Command Formatting](#command-formatting) to understand how we explain how to use each command in the following
   [Features](#features) section.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Modal Editing

Wingman offers 5 different modes through which you can manage your resources, with each mode
corresponding to one [resource](#glossary) that the app can manage:

- `crew` mode: to manage the crews that form your airline workforce
- `flight` mode: to manage the flights that your airline operates
- `location` mode: to manage the locations in which your airline operates
- `pilot` mode: to manage the pilots that form your airline workforce
- `plane` mode: to manage the planes that your airline operates

The different modes offer similar and intuitive commands, with optimisations to cater to the resource that the mode is
managing. This means you do not have to worry about memorising complex commands and instead can dive right into the
management of your airline.

To switch between different modes simply enter the following command:

```
mode XYZ
```

where XYZ can be any of the modes described above (i.e. `crew`, `flight`, `location`, `pilot`, `plane`).

Upon successfully switching to a mode, Wingman will display the current mode's name in the status bar in the bottom left
corner of the window. The window also displays a list for each resource, to aid you in keeping track of links between 
resources.

<img src="images/ug/UG-mode.jpg" width="2032">

### Command Formatting

In Wingman, a command has 3 components: a command word, required input values, and optional input values.

* A **command word** is the part which tells Wingman what operation you would like to do.
  Examples of command words might include: `add`, `delete`, or `linkflight`.

* A **required input value** is information you must include when typing a command, in order for the command
  to properly work. In Wingman, required input values are preceded with a `/prefix` where the prefix, would be an
  indicator of what value is required after it. If you forget to add a required input value, Wingman will remind you as
  you type the command.

* An **optional input value** is information you might include when typing a command, but is not necessary for the
  command
  to work. In Wingman, optional input values are preceded with a `/prefix` where the prefix, would be an indicator of
  what
  value is required after it. Optional input values are indicated in the command explanations below.

In the following [Features](#features) section, the general command format will be shown to describe it. In the general
command format, we will use "placeholders" for sections where e.g. a required prefix or required input value is
expected.
For clarity, we will detail what the placeholders are expecting.

For example,

`linklocation /lo location-index /resource-prefix resource-index`

where `resource-prefix` might be replaced by a resource entity's (recall [resource definition](#glossary)) prefix.
Furthermore,
`location-index` and `resource-index` refers to the number index of the location or resource, respectively.

Furthermore, when a prefix (required or optional) is listed, the following description is what input should follow after
the prefix. For example,

- `/lo`: the index of the location to which the crew is to be linked to.

means "the index of the location to which the crew is to be linked to" should be written after `/lo` in the command
line.

## FAQ

### 1. Why is Wingman not opening when I run the `java -jar` command?

- You might be running the command in the wrong directory.

Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the application file and run the same command again.

- Verify that your java version is 11. See the following question.

### 2. How to check my `JAVA` version?

You may run `java -version` in your terminal to see your Java SDK version.
If you need to install Java 11, please follow
this [guide](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s2.github.io/website/admin/programmingLanguages.html#programming-language).
Below is one example showing the correct version:

```agsl
openjdk version 11.0.18 2023-01-17 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.62+17-CA (build 11.0.18+10-LTS)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Zulu11.62+17-CA (build 11.0.18+10-LTS, mixed mode)
